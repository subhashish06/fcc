# Filtering and Sorting with Pokemon Data

Dive into the captivating world of Pokemon as you perform fundamental data analysis tasks like filtering and sorting. This project is not only educational but also fun, making it perfect for those just starting.

This project focuses on the main tasks of Data Analysis: filtering and sorting and question/answering. The dataset includes information of pokemons from all generations (to make it more fun!)

This project focuses on querying, filtering and sorting data with Pandas.

We'll use the following pandas methods:
- df.loc
- df.iloc
- df.query
- df.sort_values

The dataset we're going to use is one containing Pokemons. Before we begin with the activities for this project, let's do a little bit of exploration together. Feel free to skip this section altogether and jump to the activities.
