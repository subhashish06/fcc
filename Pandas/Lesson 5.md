# Data Cleaning with Google Playstore Dataset

This project is a comprehensive guide to data cleaning. Learn how to identify and rectify null values, duplicate values, outliers, and more, using a dataset scraped from the Google Playstore, which is replete with irregularities.

This project covers all the most common aspects of Data Cleaning with Pandas, using a dataset scraped from the Google Playstore.

As you might know, scraping data usually produces incorrect results.

This project includes several cleaning tasks (ranging from invalid values, to missing / duplicate values) and finished with several analysis tasks.

We encourage you to use visualizations as much as possible to understand the data as well as the missingno library, which is already installed, imported and ready to use.
