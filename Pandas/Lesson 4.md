# Matching Strings by Similarity using Levenshtein Distance

String handling is an integral aspect of data cleaning. This project introduces advanced techniques such as Combinatorics and the Levenshtein distance to detect irregularities in company names.

One of the most challenging tasks of Data Cleaning is dealing with Strings. This project is all about string handling and advanced techniques, as using the Combinatorics and the Levenshtein distance to find irregularities in company names.

In this project we're going to resolve a very tough problem, which is identifying similar strings that are not completely equal. It's a very common and challenging data cleaning task, so let's get right into it!

We have two CSVs containing company names. The problem, is that the company names in these two CSVs don't match. Both have a single column, but if you explore them, you'll immediately spot the anomalies.
